# FreeFlash ðŸš€

An opinionated, simple, scalable dev stack optimized for hosting cost reduction.

## Features

- ðŸ’° **Free:** Within the limits of 100k requests per day (static assets doesent count), you only need to pay for the domain (11 USD/year). If you need more than that, with 5 USD/month you can get up to 10M requests.
- âš¡ **Flash:** SSR on Cloudflare Workers with Elysia. [Running on edge leads to **9x smaller** _cold starts_ than traditional serverless functions and **2x faster** _warm starts_](https://www.openstatus.dev/blog/monitoring-latency-vercel-edge-vs-serverless).

```

### Sanity Token

In Sanity, go to Settings â†’ API â†’ Tokens â†’ Editor. Create a token named something like "Cloudflare Worker Sync Token" with:

## Notes

- If Vite changes, you need to run build again due to the manifest :(
